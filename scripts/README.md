# Preloading Database with Items Script

## Overview

This script is designed to facilitate the process of populating the database with items for use in my [REST-API](https://github.com/PetarIvanov01/DrizzleExpress-API/tree/main/api).

The script populates the database with fitness products, utilized in the Catalog page of my [Fitness Web App](https://github.com/PetarIvanov01/Fitness-shop).
