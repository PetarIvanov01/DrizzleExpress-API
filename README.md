# Fitness API

## Overview ⭐

Hey there! I'm excited to introduce you to my `Fitness-API` — it's the backbone of my [Fitness-Store](https://github.com/PetarIvanov01/Fitness-shop) project! 💪 As I work on this API, not only am I leveling up my coding skills, but I'm also diving deep into the awesome tech stack that makes it all possible.

I will be glad to explore the API, contribute to its development, or use it as a reference for your own projects. Also don't forget to give feedback 😅.

## Disclaimer ❗

This REST API is primarily developed for learning purposes. It may not adhere to all industry best practices, and there could be areas that need improvement. If you intend to use it I strongly recommend it to be only for educational purposes.
